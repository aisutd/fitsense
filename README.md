# FitSense

## Description

FitSense is an AI-powered personalized fitness and wellness platform. It uses goals, workout history, activity, feedback, and recovery data to recommend workouts, forecast progress, calculate an interpretable HealthScore, and power adaptive gamification.

## Planned Technologies

- Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and SQL
- React or Streamlit with Plotly
- FastAPI, Pandas, and NumPy
- Recommendation systems, forecasting, NLP, PostgreSQL, and Supabase

## Docker Setup

Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
docker compose ps
```

This is a generic starter configuration. The team can add project-specific dependencies and startup commands later.

## Backend: Profiles (onboarding data)

### Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the repo root and fill in `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`.
   Use the **service_role** key: the `profiles` table has row level security enabled, so the anon key can't read or write it.
2. In the Supabase dashboard, open the **SQL Editor**, paste in `backend/sql/001_create_profiles.sql`, and run it. It's safe to run again.
3. Run `docker compose up -d --build`. The API is at http://localhost:8000, and interactive docs are at http://localhost:8000/docs.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PUT` | `/profiles/{user_id}` | Create or replace a user's profile. Returns the stored profile. |
| `GET` | `/profiles/{user_id}` | Get a user's profile, or `404` if none exists. |

`user_id` is a UUID, which the frontend generates for now (`crypto.randomUUID()`). Height and weight are **metric** (cm and kg). Invalid data is rejected with `422`.

Example request body:

```json
{
  "age": 21,
  "height_cm": 175.3,
  "weight_kg": 70.2,
  "fitness_goal": "build_muscle",
  "fitness_level": "beginner",
  "workout_frequency": 4,
  "workout_location": "gym",
  "workout_preferences": ["strength", "cardio"]
}
```

| Field | Allowed values |
|---|---|
| `age` | 13–100 |
| `height_cm` | 100–250 |
| `weight_kg` | 30–300 |
| `fitness_goal` | `lose_weight`, `build_muscle`, `improve_endurance`, `general_fitness`, `increase_flexibility` |
| `fitness_level` | `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced` |
| `workout_frequency` | 1–7 (days per week) |
| `workout_location` | `home`, `gym`, `outdoors`, `mixed` |
| `workout_preferences` | optional list of `strength`, `cardio`, `hiit`, `yoga`, `pilates`, `sports`, `calisthenics` |

### Tests

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest                                        # unit tests, no Supabase needed
python scripts/smoke_test_profiles.py         # live test against the running backend + Supabase
```
